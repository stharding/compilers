/* checktest8.wb - Odd and ends

This file contains an assortment of miscellaneous errors you might detect.
These mostly concern further interaction between builtin type names
and everything else.

Keep in mind that if you don't catch these, your compiler will still
handle correct code.  It's just that error messages for incorrect 
code might be inscrutable and users of your compiler will curse at you.

var a int = 3 + 4.5;   // How many errors get reported for this?
                       // There is a type error in the expression, but
                       // does that type error also show up in the variable
                       // assignment?
