/* checktest3.wb - Introducing types

All data in Wabbit has an associated type.  You need to start building
the type system.  Go to the file wabbit/typesys.py and look at the
instructions there.   When you come back, start work on attaching
types to objects.

Your first task: attach types to simple literals.   Run this
test using:

        bash % python3 -m wabbit.checker Tests/checktest3.wb --show-types

You should see types attached to the literal values.

print 2;              // Verify that "int" type is attached
print 3.5;            // Verify that "float" type is attached
print 'h';            // Verify that "char" type is attached
