/* This is a particularly tricky case.  How do you want to report
   errors that propagate through a large expression?   Every operation
   needs to produce some kind of type for later stages of checking to
   work. However, once an error is reported, they tend to cascade.
   So, does this expression produce a single type error (1+2.0) or
   does it produce 5 type errors (one for each operator)?

   You don't really need to "fix" anything here, but if you're 
   getting 5 type errors for a single expression, it might be a
   usability enhancement to not be so noisy.
