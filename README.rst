Write a Compiler in Python
==========================

Edition: March 18, 2019

Course materials
----------------

Most of the course materials can be found in `doc/html/index.html <doc/html/index.html>`_.

Presentation Slides
-------------------

Presentation slides can be found in `CompilerSlides.pdf <CompilerSlides.pdf>`_.

Requirements
------------
For the project, you need to have Python 3.7+, llvmlite, clang, and SLY installed.
The first two requirements can be satisfied by installing Anaconda Python.  SLY can be
installed using ``python3 -m pip install sly``.

Important directories
----------------------

The following directories are used in the project.

* ``doc/``.  Documentation and project descriptions.
* ``wabbit/``.  Directory where you will do most of your work.
* ``wabbits/``.  Reference solution of the project. Peek at it for hints.
* ``Exercises/``.  Directory where you will work exercises.
* ``Tests/``. Directory of test programs (used in various stages of the project).

Reference Language
------------------

You will be compiling a small language called "Wabbit".  If you want
to experiment with Wabbit (the language), go to the ``SillyWabbit/``
directory. The script ``wabbit.py`` can (hopefully) be used to run any
valid Wabbit program and show you the output.
