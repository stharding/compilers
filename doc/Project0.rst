Project 0 - Silly Wabbit
------------------------

We're going to write a compiler for a small language call "Wabbit."
The following files describe its features in some detail:

.. toctree::
  Overview
  Wabbit
  :maxdepth: 1

However, it might be more useful to just jump into it.  In the top
level ``compilers/`` directory, you'll find a directory
``SillyWabbit/``.  In that directory, you'll find a script `wabbit.py`
and three Wabbit programs, ``prog1.wb``, ``prog2.wb``, and
``prog3.wb``.  Go to each file and follow the instructions inside.
Basically, you need to run each program and then make some
modifications to it.  The main purpose of this exercise is simply to
see the language you're writing in action.
